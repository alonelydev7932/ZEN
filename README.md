## Features
Zen provides a rich set of features to help increase user performance, security, gui design and overall feel:

*   **Login UI** - Login with username and password supported as well as registering.
*   **GUI** - Example of theming setup within the loader.
*   **Themes** - Both light and dark have been added.
*   **Splash Screen** - Help prevent lag and other issues using the cool splash.
*   **Random Strings** - Title changing, Exe renaming.
*   **Security** - Win32 InputBlock, Anti Dump and Anti Debug protection.
*   **Inproved Update System** - Structure for auto application updates has been adjusted.

## Keyboard Input Handling
ZEN respects security, using Win32 api you are able to freeze Input devices. For example, while running important code, loading drivers or even freezing due to vulnerability. This can be accessed using the code below, simply add this to your desired class / form.

```java
public static void BlockInput(bool toggle) {
if (toggle)
{
ZEN._0x02.mcyAy.BlockInput(true);
}
else if (!toggle)
{
ZEN._0x02.mcyAy.BlockInput(true);
}
}
```
